# Student Record Management System (Python)

A command-line based Student Record Management System built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming principles.  
This project allows efficient management of student records with persistent storage and basic algorithmic optimizations.

---

## Features
- Add new student records
- Update student marks
- Delete student records using roll number
- Display all student records
- Sort students by marks (descending order)
- Search student by roll number using Binary Search
- Persistent storage using file handling
- Export student data to CSV format

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms
- CSV File Handling

## Time Complexity Analysis
- Add Student: **O(1)**
- Show All Students: **O(n)**
- Update Student: **O(n)**
- Delete Student: **O(n)**
- Linear Search: **O(n)**
- Binary Search: **O(log n)** (after sorting)
- Sorting Students: **O(n log n)**

---

## Key Learnings
- Applied Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python
- Implemented CRUD operations in a CLI application
- Used file handling for persistent data storage
- Implemented searching and sorting algorithms
- Exported structured data to CSV for external use

---

## Future Improvements
- Integrate a database for scalable storage
- Add user authentication
- Implement unit testing
- Improve input validation
