# Student Record Management System (Python)

A command-line based **Student Record Management System** developed using **Python** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
This project enables efficient management of student records with **persistent storage** and basic **algorithmic optimizations**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add new student records
- Update student marks
- Delete student records using roll number
- Display all student records
- Sort students by marks (descending order)
- Search students by roll number using **Binary Search**
- Persistent storage using file handling
- Export student data to **CSV format**

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms
- CSV File Handling
- Git & GitHub

## ⏱ Time Complexity Analysis
Add Student: O(1)
Show All Students: O(n)
Update Student: O(n)
Delete Student: O(n)
Linear Search: O(n)
Binary Search: O(log n) (after sorting)
Sorting Students: O(n log n)
